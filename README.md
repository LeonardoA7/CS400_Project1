Frontend.java and FrontendStatic.java both compile to a Frontend.class
The difference is that FrontendStatic is entirely static and can be run on it's own, where Frontend needs to be instantiated and run by another class (using the .run(Backend back) method)

There are comments in all three files for minor changes that will need to be made during integration of the backend
