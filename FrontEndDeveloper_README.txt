Frontend.java - A non-static frontend that can be instantiated to display menus and diplay searched movies
FrontendStatic.java - A static frontend that can be executed without needing to be instantiated by another class
TestFrontend.java - A testing class that instantiates a frontend, tests it's functionality, and prints the results

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
Idk if this counts or is just expected: Writing all code for integration, so the IM just has to uncomment some lines, and delete some other marked lines

TestFrontend.java was partially prewritten, I just expanded the tests
The escape character sequence in the clearScreen() method was taken from StackOverflow
